  <p>
    LetThemCook! respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the

  <p>
    This app is designed for general consumers and does not require you to create an account or sign up with an email
    address.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    LetThemCook! is built to minimise data collection. The information handled by the app is limited to what is
    necessary for core functionality.
  </p>

  <h3>Camera and Images (Menus or Your Own Photos)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The app allows you to capture a photo using your device camera or select an existing photo from your device to scan text (OCR).</li>
    <li>Images are used temporarily on your device for cropping and text recognition (OCR).</li>
    <li>Images are <strong>not stored</strong>, <strong>not uploaded</strong>, and <strong>not retained</strong> by us after processing is complete.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Text from Images (OCR Output)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>After OCR, the recognised text may be transmitted to our servers and/or AI providers to generate recipes and related outputs.</li>
    <li>We use this text only to provide the requested feature and improve app functionality.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Location Information</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The app may request access to your <strong>precise location</strong> to identify nearby restaurants at the moment you use the feature.</li>
    <li>Location data is used only in real time.</li>
    <li>Location data is <strong>not stored</strong>, <strong>not linked to your identity</strong>, and <strong>not used for tracking</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Anonymous Identifier (No Sign-up Required)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The app may create an <strong>anonymous identifier</strong> to support core functionality such as saving app state, managing entitlements, and associating generated content with your device session.</li>
    <li>This identifier is not an email address and does not require you to create an account.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Usage and Diagnostics Data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The app may collect <strong>anonymous usage events</strong>, such as paywall views or interactions, strictly to support app functionality and basic analytics.</li>
    <li>The app may collect crash reports and performance diagnostics through Apple’s built-in tools.</li>
    <li>This information does not identify you personally.</li>
  </ul>

  </ul>

  <hr />

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>Any information handled by the app is used only to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide core app features, such as scanning text and (where applicable) identifying nearby restaurants</li>
    <li>Generate recipes and related outputs based on recognised text</li>
    <li>Display and manage subscription access</li>
    <li>Improve app stability and performance</li>
    <li>Understand general feature usage in an anonymous way</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We do not use data for advertising, marketing, or tracking across apps or websites.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Images are processed on-device and discarded immediately.</li>
    <li>Location data is used only at the time of the request and is not retained.</li>
    <li>Recognised text and generated outputs may be retained as needed to provide features such as recipe history (if enabled in the app) and to support app operation.</li>
    <li>Anonymous usage and diagnostic data may be retained in aggregated form to support app operation and improvements.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>LetThemCook! uses the following third-party services solely to operate the app:</p>

  <h3>Apple Services</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>StoreKit</strong> for In-App Purchases and subscriptions. Payment information is handled entirely by Apple. We do not receive or store payment details.</li>
    <li>Apple’s crash and performance diagnostics tools.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Superwall</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Superwall is used to display paywalls and help manage subscription entitlements.</li>
    <li>Superwall may collect device information and usage events (for example, paywall views or interactions) to provide analytics and improve performance.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>No third-party services are used for advertising or cross-app tracking.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>User Privacy Rights</h2>
  <p>You control access to device features such as the camera, photo library, and location through iOS system settings.</p>
  <p>You can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Deny or revoke camera, photo library, or location permissions at any time</li>
    <li>Manage or cancel subscriptions through your Apple ID settings</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Because the app does not require sign-up with personal details, there is no personal user profile to access, modify,
    or delete.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>LetThemCook! is not directed to children under the age of 13.</p>

    information through the app, please contact us so we can address the issue.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. Any
    updates will be posted on this page with a revised “Last updated” date.
